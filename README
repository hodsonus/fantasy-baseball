I created this script because I was sick of constantly ripping the player list by hand in my dynasty fantasy baseball league.
This script uses BeautifulSoup, Mechanize, and Pandas to rip and generate a player list from Yahoo Fantasy Sports.

The excel spreadsheet allows me to import my own ranks and further analyze the availabel players with resources outside of Yahoo.

Create a config.py file, and configure it as direted in the file. Then run the code with 'python3 ripper.py'.
